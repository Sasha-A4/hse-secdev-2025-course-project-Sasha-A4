# Evidence Directory

This directory contains security and compliance artifacts generated by CI/CD workflows.

## Structure

- `P09/` - SBOM and SCA artifacts from P09 workflow
- `P10/` - SAST and secrets scanning artifacts from P10 workflow

## P09 Artifacts

Generated by `.github/workflows/ci-sbom-sca.yml`:

- `sbom.json` - Software Bill of Materials in CycloneDX JSON format
  - Generated using Syft (v0.120.0)
  - Contains all dependencies and their versions
  - Used as input for SCA scanning

- `sca_report.json` - Software Composition Analysis report
  - Generated using Grype (v0.78.0)
  - Contains detailed vulnerability information
  - JSON format for programmatic processing

- `sca_summary.md` - Human-readable summary of vulnerabilities
  - Aggregated counts by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Negligible/Unknown)
  - List of Critical and High severity vulnerabilities
  - Next steps and recommendations

## Accessing Artifacts

Artifacts are automatically uploaded to GitHub Actions and can be downloaded from:
- Workflow run page → Artifacts section
- Available for 30 days after workflow completion

## Traceability

Each artifact includes:
- Commit SHA
- Workflow run ID
- Generation timestamp

This allows linking artifacts to specific code versions and CI runs.

## Usage

## P10 Artifacts

Generated by `.github/workflows/ci-sast-secrets.yml`:

- `semgrep.sarif` - Static Application Security Testing results
  - Generated using Semgrep
  - Uses `p/ci` profile and custom rules from `security/semgrep/rules.yml`
  - SARIF format for integration with GitHub Code Scanning

- `gitleaks.json` - Secrets scanning report
  - Generated using Gitleaks
  - Scans repository for hardcoded secrets and credentials
  - Uses configuration from `security/.gitleaks.toml`

- `sast_summary.md` - Human-readable summary of SAST and secrets findings
  - Aggregated counts by severity
  - List of key findings
  - Next steps and recommendations

## Usage

These artifacts can be used for:
